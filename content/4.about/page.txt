The Chemistry Club at Trinity University is a nationally recognized,
student-run organization that aims to serve the students in our
department as well as the wider University and San Antonio communities
through a wide range of volunteer-based activities, such as chemistry
demonstrations, student mentoring, and faculty-student social events.
Everyone is welcome to attend our events and to help out, and there is
no membership fee or any other obligation.  The Events page lists
currently scheduled activities for this semester.  If you have any
questions, feel free to contact our 2011-2012 officers or our faculty
sponsor.  We do this because itâ€™s fun and it helps people, and we hope to see you this year!
